## What is Progressive LOD?

![LodBehaviors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RottenVisions/progressivelod/master/readme-src/lod-behavior.png)

A complete LOD system that allows for full customization of LODs. LODs are automatically made
for the model as well with 20 LODs created. Meshes are progressively reduced based on the
screen ratio the model has.
